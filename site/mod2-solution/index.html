	    	<h2>Arizona in January</h2>
	      	<p>Arizona is a magical place because I did not know that much dirt existed in one place. We drove for 3.5 hours from Vegas to the South Rim of the Grand Canyon and I want to say about 80% of that drive was just overlooking endless stretches of dirt. Not even grass, just barren ground for miles and miles. But then in the great distance, you can see these mountains that appear as if Bob Ross painted them into existence. They were so far away that they didn’t even seem real. But by the time three hours have gone by, the tall glorious peaks were on either side of the highway. Arizona went from this barren wasteland to this magnificent landscape. And suddenly, we were there.

	      	The canyon’s gorge stretched for what seemed like an eternity. All along the drive and the hike to the canyon are markers to indicate the rising elevation, but I didn’t really get it until I stood at the end of the canyon and peered down. If you fell from where I was standing, it would most certainly be certain death. And yet, I felt no fear. Just awe. So many visitors were trying to find the right angle for an epic selfie, myself included, but pictures truly don’t do the Grand Canyon justice. On my phone, I have about 70 pictures of just the landscape and yet not a single one holds a candle to the real thing. I was glad to take this trip over this last break because it was a reminder of what the world has to offer. Don’t get me wrong, there are tons of manmade structures that can take your breath away, but there is true beauty in the unplanned.</p>

	    	<h2>My Trip Part Deux</h2>
	        <p>The Vegas experience has been depicted in countless Hollywood productions. We saw it when the Wolf Pack lost Doug on the roof (The Hangover); we saw it when George Clooney and company took down three casinos at once (Ocean’s Eleven); we even saw it when a team of MIT students followed Kevin Spacey’s lead to embark on a dangerous counting cards adventure (21). Now that I’ve actually been there, I can attest that Vegas is such an experience, but not just what it shown in the movies. There is so much to do in that city in a very lowkey manner.

	        One of the highlights of this Vegas trip was finally having In-N-Out and it was totally worth it. It may be just another fast food chain, but that burger was super tasty and the animal style fries were to my liking. If you’re ever in Vegas and don’t know what to do, go see a show. Just like New York or LA, there are tons of talented singers and dancer that are worth your time. I brought tickets to see a show about the origins of Vegas and I was upgraded from my seat in the back to basically front row. After that, I ended up in a cocktail lounge listening to this cover band that was absolutely <b><em>KILLING</em></b> it. There is plenty of time to gamble your money away or hit the clubs, but Vegas is also good for a more chill kind of night.I honestly can't wait to go back, now that I actually know people over there.Currently, such a trip would certainly fall under the category "unnecessary travel" and I'm sure the CDC would not approve.</p>
